      ## PWA Service Worker Cache Synchronization Required?

      A change was detected in either `service-worker.js` or a potentially relevant static asset (JS, CSS, Icon, Image, Manifest).

      **This change might require updating the list of assets cached in the `install` event of `src/mus/infrastructure/web/static/service-worker.js`.**

      **Action Required:**
      1.  **Review the recent file changes:** Was a core static asset (like essential CSS, JS, main icon, or manifest) added, removed, or renamed?
      2.  **Inspect `service-worker.js`:** Locate the `cache.addAll([...])` call within the `install` event listener.
      3.  **Manually Verify & Update:** Compare the list of URLs inside `cache.addAll` with the *expected* core static assets needed for the basic offline shell. Add, remove, or update URLs in the list to reflect the current state of essential files.

      **Expected Core Static Assets (Verify this list):**
      ```javascript
      // Example expected assets inside cache.addAll([...])
      [
        '/', // Often represents index.html via routing
        '/static/css/style.css',
        '/static/js/main.js',
        '/static/js/audioManager.js',
        '/static/js/trackManager.js',
        '/static/js/uiControls.js',
        '/static/js/stateManager.js',
        '/static/js/volume.js',
        '/static/manifest.json',
        '/static/images/placeholder.svg', // If used offline
        '/static/android-chrome-512x512.png' // Core app icon
      ]
      ```
      **Note:** Only include assets *essential* for the basic application shell to load offline. Not every static file needs to be in this initial cache.
