      Follow these CSS/PostCSS development standards:

      1.  **Tailwind CSS First:**
          - The primary method of styling is Tailwind CSS utility classes applied directly in `.svelte` or `.html` files.
          - `src/app.postcss` (or similar entry point) should primarily contain Tailwind directives:
            ```css
            @tailwind base;
            @tailwind components;
            @tailwind utilities;
