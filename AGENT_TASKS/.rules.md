# AGENT_TASKS Framework Rules

This document outlines the rules and format for managing and executing tasks using the AGENT_TASKS framework.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity**: Tasks must be well-defined for AI understanding.
- **Simplicity**: Tasks are in human-readable Markdown.
- **Maintainability**: Each task is self-contained.
- **Traceability**: Detailed structure for progress tracking.

## Task File Format

- **File Naming**: `brief-task-description.md` (e.g., `implement-user-authentication.md`).
- **Location**: `AGENT_TASKS/` directory.
- **Format**: Plain Markdown. Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subtasks, and minimal extra spacing.

## Task File Structure

Each task file (`.md`) must follow this structure:

## User Problem

**REQUIRED**. The problem this task solves from the user's perspective.

## High-Level Solution

**REQUIRED**. Brief overview of the technical approach.

## Success Metrics

**REQUIRED**. Measurable outcomes indicating success (e.g., specific behaviors, performance targets, user satisfaction criteria).

## Context

**REQUIRED**. Background information, existing systems, technical constraints, architectural considerations, or other details the AI needs to understand the environment.

## Detailed Description

**REQUIRED**. A comprehensive explanation of the feature, bug, or chore. This section should provide all necessary details for the AI to understand the task's goal and scope.
- Can include: Architecture Overview (how this integrates with existing systems), Dependent Components (other systems/features this relies on), API Specifications (endpoints, payloads, responses), Data Models (key data structures), UI details (if applicable), non-functional requirements, links to designs or related documents, etc.

## Requirements (Optional)

List any specific requirements.
- Examples: Constraints (technical limitations, business rules), Regulatory Considerations.

## Implementation Considerations (Optional)

Note any specific technical approaches or potential challenges.

## Dependencies (Optional)

List any external services, libraries, or APIs required.

## Security Considerations (Optional)

Note any authentication, authorization, or data protection needs.

## Subtasks (Highly Recommended)

Break down the main task into smaller, actionable steps.
Each subtask MUST be an H3 heading and include the following fields directly below it:

- **Status**: `[ ]` (To Do) or `[x]` (Completed). This is part of the H3 heading (e.g., `### [ ] 1. Subtask Title`).
- **Description**: (Bolded Label) A concise, single-line summary of what the subtask entails.
- **Details**: (Bolded Label, Multiline) Specific instructions, implementation notes, edge cases to consider, or acceptance criteria for this subtask. Explain *what* needs to be done and *why*, and any important considerations for the AI.
- **Filepaths to Modify**: (Bolded Label) A single line of comma-separated, individually backticked file paths that are *assumed* to be modified or created (e.g., `path/one.js, path/two.svelte, path/three.py`). If no files are to be modified (e.g., a research, verification, or planning step), state `(None, this is a ... step)`. These are initial assumptions and might be refined as the task progresses.

### Example Task File (`AGENT_TASKS/enhance-product-card-display.md`)

```markdown
# Enhance Product Card Display

## User Problem
Users cannot easily see stock levels or discounts on the product listing page and must click into product details, which is inefficient.

## High-Level Solution
Modify the `ProductCard` Svelte component to display stock indicators and discount percentages. Update data fetching and types accordingly.

## Success Metrics
- Product cards display "Out of Stock", "Low Stock", or "In Stock" based on `stockQuantity`.
- Product cards display a discount badge (e.g., "-15%") if `discountPercentage > 0`.
- All `ProductCard` instances on the product listing page correctly reflect these new details.
- The changes are visually integrated without cluttering the card.
- `make ci` passes without any errors.

## Context
- Frontend: SvelteKit and TypeScript, using Svelte 5 runes for reactivity.
- Product data fetched in `src/routes/products/+page.server.ts`.
- `ProductCard` component: `src/lib/components/domain/ProductCard.svelte`.
- Styling is done using Tailwind CSS.
- Backend API endpoint `/api/v1/products/{id}` (or similar list endpoint) is assumed to provide `stockQuantity` (number) and `discountPercentage` (number, 0 if no discount).

## Detailed Description
Enhance `ProductCard` to:
1.  Display stock levels:
    -   `stockQuantity` 0: "Out of Stock" (e.g., greyed out).
    -   `stockQuantity` > 0 and < 10: "Low Stock" (e.g., orange/yellow text).
    -   `stockQuantity` >= 10: "In Stock" (e.g., green text).
    -   `stockQuantity` undefined: No stock display.
2.  Display discount badge:
    -   If `discountPercentage > 0`, show badge (e.g., "-15%") in top-right of image.
    -   Badge styling: noticeable (e.g., red background, white text, rounded).
3.  Update `ProductCard` to accept new props: `stockQuantity?: number`, `discountPercentage?: number`.
4.  Update data fetching in `src/routes/products/+page.server.ts` for new fields.
5.  Update relevant types in `src/lib/types/index.ts`.
*Architecture Overview*: Changes are localized to the Svelte frontend, primarily affecting the `ProductCard` component and its data sources.
*API Specifications*: No direct API changes, but assumes backend provides `stockQuantity` and `discountPercentage` in product data.
*Data Models*: The `Track` (or equivalent Product) type in `src/lib/types/index.ts` will need new optional fields.

## Requirements
- The new information should not significantly increase the card's height.
- Load time for the product listing page should remain acceptable.

## Implementation Considerations
- Ensure new props in `ProductCard` have default values to avoid breaking existing usages if data is not immediately available.
- Use `$derived` for reactive text based on stock/discount values.

## Subtasks

### [ ] 1. Update `ProductCard.svelte` props and UI structure
**Description**: Add `stockQuantity` and `discountPercentage` props; add HTML placeholders.
**Details**: Define new props: `stockQuantity?: number` and `discountPercentage?: number`. Add `div`/`span` elements for stock indicator and discount badge. Minimal initial styling.
**Filepaths to Modify**: `src/lib/components/domain/ProductCard.svelte`

### [ ] 2. Implement stock level display logic and styling in `ProductCard.svelte`
**Description**: Add logic for stock level text and apply Tailwind CSS.
**Details**: Use Svelte 5 runes for reactive display. Styling: `text-red-600` (Low Stock), `text-green-600` (In Stock), `text-gray-500` (Out of Stock). Position appropriately.
**Filepaths to Modify**: `src/lib/components/domain/ProductCard.svelte`

### [ ] 3. Implement discount badge display logic and styling in `ProductCard.svelte`
**Description**: Add logic for discount badge display and apply Tailwind CSS.
**Details**: Position badge (e.g., top-right of image). Style: e.g., `bg-red-500 text-white text-xs font-semibold px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded-full`. Display format: `-${discountPercentage}%`. Only show if `discountPercentage > 0`.
**Filepaths to Modify**: `src/lib/components/domain/ProductCard.svelte`

### [ ] 4. Update product data types and fetching logic
**Description**: Modify product type in `src/lib/types/index.ts` and data fetching in `src/routes/products/+page.server.ts` and `+page.svelte`.
**Details**: Add `stockQuantity?: number;` and `discountPercentage?: number;` to the Product/Track type. Ensure `load` function in `+page.server.ts` fetches/returns these. Pass new props from `+page.svelte` to `ProductCard`.
**Filepaths to Modify**: `src/lib/types/index.ts`, `src/routes/products/+page.server.ts`, `src/routes/products/+page.svelte`
