      "description": "Correct SQLAlchemy transaction management in `SQLiteTrackRepository`",
      "details": "The `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Can't operate on closed transaction inside context manager` error occurs because `SQLiteTrackRepository` methods (`upsert_track`, `set_cover_flag`) contain explicit `await self.session.commit()` calls. These conflict with the transaction management (`async with self.track_repository.session.begin():`) already present in `ScanTracksUseCase._process_batch`. To resolve this, remove the explicit `await self.session.commit()` calls from the `upsert_track` and `set_cover_flag` methods within `backend/src/mus/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite_track_repository.py`. The transaction will be managed by the calling use case. Update tests in `backend/tests/persistence/test_sqlite_track_repository.py` as necessary. Tests that previously relied on the auto-commit behavior of these repository methods may need to be adjusted to explicitly manage transactions, for instance, by wrapping repository calls within an `async with session.begin():` block or by calling `await session.commit()` if the test's session object is already part of an outer transaction.",

      "description": "Make backend music scanning synchronous during startup for debugging.",
      "details": "In `backend/src/mus/main.py`, locate the `lifespan` asynchronous context manager. Within this manager, the music scanning process is initiated by `run_scan()`. Modify the invocation from `asyncio.create_task(run_scan()())` to `await run_scan()()`. This change will cause the server startup to block until the `run_scan` coroutine completes, ensuring that all logs and errors from the scanning process are outputted synchronously to the console during development server startup (e.g., when using `make om-up`). Update `backend/tests/test_main_startup.py`: remove any mocks or assertions related to `asyncio.create_task` for the `run_scan` call. Ensure other parts of the startup test (DB reset, cover cleaning, and that `ScanTracksUseCase.scan_directory` is ultimately called via `run_scan`) still pass.",

      "description": "Update Track.added_at to use file modification time.",
      "details": "1. Modify `backend/src/mus/domain/entities/track.py`: Change the `Track.added_at` field from `added_at: int = Field(default_factory=lambda: int(time.time()))` to `added_at: int`. Remove the `default_factory` and ensure `import time` is removed if no longer used in this file. 2. Modify `backend/src/mus/application/use_cases/scan_tracks_use_case.py`: Import `os`. In the `_extract_metadata_sync` method, after successfully obtaining the audio file object (e.g., `audio = MP3(file_path)`), add `metadata[\"mtime\"] = int(os.path.getmtime(file_path))` to populate the modification time. In the `_process_batch` method (or wherever the `Track` entity is instantiated from `metadata`), ensure that `added_at=metadata[\"mtime\"]` is used during `Track` instantiation. 3. Modify `backend/src/mus/infrastructure/persistence/sqlite_track_repository.py`: In the `upsert_track` method, ensure that `track_data.added_at` (which now contains the file's mtime) is included in the `track_dict` that is passed to `sqlite_upsert(Track).values(**track_dict)`. Also, ensure the `on_conflict_do_update` set clause includes `added_at=stmt.excluded.added_at` to update this field if the file path conflicts and the mtime is different. Testing: Add unit tests for `ScanTracksUseCase._extract_metadata_sync` to verify correct `mtime` extraction (mock `os.path.getmtime`). Update/add integration tests for `SQLiteTrackRepository.upsert_track` to verify: a) new track insertion sets `added_at` to mtime, b) updating an existing track with a different mtime updates `added_at`, c) updating an existing track with the same mtime leaves `added_at` effectively unchanged. Ensure `make ci` passes.",
