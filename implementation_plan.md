# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Setup
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Configuration files
- [x] Development environment
- [x] Basic logging setup
- [x] Docker configuration

## Phase 2: Domain Layer
- [x] Define Track entity
- [x] Implement track-related domain services

## Phase 3: Application Layer
- [ ] Implement track scanning service

- [ ] Implement web API endpoints for tracks
- [ ] Implement HTMX frontend for track listing
- [ ] Implement audio streaming for tracks

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create user documentation

## Phase 6: Deployment
- [ ] Production Docker configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
